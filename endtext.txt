Hogwarts,Hogwarts,Hoggy Warty Hogwarts
Teach us something please
Whether we be old and bald
Or young with scabby knees
Our heads could do with filling
With some interesting stuff
So teach us things worth knowing
Bring back what we have forgot
Just do your best,we'll do the rest
And learn until our brains all rot
